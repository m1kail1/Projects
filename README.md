checkPal.c will scan a message from the user and will check
if the message is a palindrome or not. It will then print out
a string stating if it is a palindrome or not.

checkPasswd.c will take an input password from the user and
will run this password through a series of tests to check if
the password is safe based on certain criteria. If the
password does not meet these criteria, points will be 
deducted. By the end of the program if there are too
many points deducted, our program will print out that
the password is not safe.
